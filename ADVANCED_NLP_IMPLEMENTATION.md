## 🎯 Algorithm Details

### Coreference Resolution

**Rule-Based Algorithm**
- Extracts mentions (pronouns, noun phrases, named entities)
- Uses linguistic features: number, gender, person
- Applies pronoun resolution rules
- Builds coreference clusters using similarity matching

**Mention-Pair Model**
- Evaluates all mention pairs for coreference likelihood
- Uses similarity function based on:
  * Exact text match
  * Head noun matching for noun phrases
  * String containment
  * Number and gender agreement
- Groups mentions using threshold-based clustering

**Cluster-Based Algorithm**
- Incrementally builds entity clusters
- Compares each mention to existing clusters
- Adds to best-matching cluster or creates new one
- Uses average cluster similarity for assignment

### Relation & Event Extraction

**Pattern-Based Relations**
- Uses 14+ predefined linguistic patterns
- Covers relation types:
  * Employment (works for, employed by)
  * Leadership (CEO of, president of)
  * Ownership (owns, acquired, purchased)
  * Location (located in, based in)
  * Family relations (married to, child of)
  * Creation (founded, invented, created)
  * Membership (member of, belongs to)

**Dependency-Based Relations**
- Analyzes sentence structure for SVO triples
- Extracts subject-verb-object relationships
- More flexible than patterns
- Discovers relations not in predefined patterns

**Event Extraction**
- Identifies 7 event types:
  * Movement (went, traveled, moved)
  * Transaction (bought, sold, acquired)
  * Communication (announced, reported, stated)
  * Conflict (attacked, fought, destroyed)
  * Creation (created, built, established)
  * Change (became, changed, transformed)
  * Meeting (met, visited, gathered)
- Extracts event components:
  * Agent (who performed the action)
  * Participants (who was involved)
  * Time (when it occurred)
  * Location (where it occurred)

### Argument Mining

**Rule-Based Mining**
- Detects claims using:
  * Modal verbs (should, must, ought)
  * Belief verbs (believe, think, argue)
  * Evaluative adjectives (important, essential)
  * Comparison structures
- Detects premises using:
  * Causal connectors (because, since)
  * Evidence phrases (research shows, data indicates)
  * Statistics and numbers
  * Examples (for example, such as)
- Builds complete argument structures
- Links premises to claims
- Identifies counter-arguments

**Pattern-Based Mining**
- Uses specific linguistic patterns:
  * "I [verb] that..." for claims
  * "we should [verb]" for claims
  * "because [noun] [verb]" for premises
  * "therefore [noun] [verb]" for conclusions
- Fast extraction for formal text
- Good for well-structured arguments

**Structured Analysis**
- Assumes linear argument structure
- First sentence often contains main claim
- Following sentences provide premises
- Analyzes complete paragraphs as units
- Works well for essay-style content

## 📈 Technical Features
