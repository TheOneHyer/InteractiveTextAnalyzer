# Readability Statistics Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive readability statistics analysis using six established readability formulas. The feature evaluates text complexity and provides interpretations to help users understand content accessibility.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Function: `analyzeReadability()`
**Location:** `src/utils/textAnalysis.js`

Implements six readability algorithms:

1. **Flesch Reading Ease** (0-100 scale)
   - Formula: 206.835 - 1.015(words/sentences) - 84.6(syllables/words)
   - Higher scores = easier text
   - Scale: 90-100 (5th grade) to 0-30 (college graduate)

2. **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level**
   - Formula: 0.39(words/sentences) + 11.8(syllables/words) - 15.59
   - Returns U.S. grade level

3. **Coleman-Liau Index**
   - Formula: 0.0588L - 0.296S - 15.8 (L=letters/100 words, S=sentences/100 words)
   - Uses character count instead of syllables
   - More reliable for computer analysis

4. **Gunning Fog Index**
   - Formula: 0.4 * ((words/sentences) + 100 * (complex words/words))
   - Emphasizes complex words (3+ syllables)
   - Estimates years of education needed

5. **SMOG Index**
   - Formula: 1.0430 * √(polysyllables * 30/sentences) + 3.1291
   - Designed for health care materials
   - Simple Measure of Gobbledygook

6. **Automated Readability Index (ARI)**
   - Formula: 4.71(characters/words) + 0.5(words/sentences) - 21.43
   - Fast and reliable
   - Returns approximate grade level

### 2. Unit Tests
**Location:** `src/test/readability.test.js`

Comprehensive test suite with:
- **19 test suites**
- **67+ individual test cases**
- Coverage includes:
  - Basic functionality (empty inputs, edge cases)
  - Simple vs. complex text comparisons
